# fortios_firewall_security_policyseq
Provides a resource to alter firewall security policy sequence

## Example Usage
```hcl
provider "fortios" {
	hostname = "54.226.179.231"
	token = "jn3t3Nw7qckQzt955Htkfj5hwQ6jdb"
}

resource "fortios_firewall_security_policy" "test1" {
        name = "test_policy1"
        srcintf = ["port2", "port1"]
        dstintf = ["port3"]
        srcaddr = ["all"]
        dstaddr = ["all"]
        schedule = "always"
        service = ["ALL_ICMP"]
        action = "accept"
}
resource "fortios_firewall_security_policy" "test2" {
        name = "test_policy2"
        srcintf = ["port1", "port3"]
        dstintf = ["port2"]
        srcaddr = ["all"]
        dstaddr = ["all"]
        schedule = "always"
        service = ["ALL_ICMP"]
        action = "accept"
}
resource "fortios_firewall_security_policy" "test3" {
        name = "test_policy3"
        srcintf = ["port1", "port3"]
        dstintf = ["port2"]
        srcaddr = ["all"]
        dstaddr = ["all"]
        schedule = "always"
        service = ["ALL_ICMP"]
        action = "accept"
}

resource "fortios_firewall_security_policyseq" "test1" {
        policy_src_id = 3
        policy_dst_id = 1
        alter_position = "before"
}

Assumptions:
1. In this example, the related three security policies should be created on FortiOS first.
2. Assume that the policy id and name have the following maps:
    test_policy1: 1
    test_policy2: 2
    test_policy3: 3
   And the sequence of those three policies on the FortiOS are 1,2,3

Expected Result:
After the action of the above example, the policies on the FortiOS are 3,1,2
```
